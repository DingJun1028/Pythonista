# Pythonista

This repository hosts the official community forum for everything related to [Pythonista](https://pythonista.app) and this ReadMe with links to other useful resources.

## What is Pythonista?

Pythonista is an iOS app for developing and running Python scripts locally on iPad and iPhone. I released the first version for the original iPad over 12 years ago, but the app has grown and adapted to the advancements in both iOS and the Python language.

Pythonista provides everything you need to start coding right away – a native Python runtime with many included open-source libraries, a touch-optimized code editor, an interactive console, and many other tools.

Pythonista is exclusively available on the App Store without a subscription, as a one-time purchase.

## Community Forum & Issue Tracker

Unfortunately, the old community forum was essentially run over by bots, and I don't have the resources for the maintenance that was required to host this myself. I've decided to move the forum to GitHub, using the [*Discussions*](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista/discussions) feature of this repository.

For posting bug reports, please use the [Pythonista-Issues](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista-Issues) repository.
